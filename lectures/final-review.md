# Final Review (Spring 2020)

**TBA**

# Format

- Same as the midterm
- Open notes: bring as much printed material as you want
- Closed computers / phones / everything else
- If you're asked to write in a language, I will give you the grammar
- I *won't* give you compiler passes, evaluators, etc.
- Should take only 30-40 minutes
- If you successfully completed the homework assignments, the questions should be easy
- Liberal partial credit applied (especially when you're asked to write code)
