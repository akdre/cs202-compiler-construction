# Final Review (Spring 2019)

**NOTE: This document is from Spring 2019, and has not yet been updated**

# Format

- Same as the midterm
- Open notes: bring as much printed material as you want
- Closed computers / phones / everything else
- If you're asked to write in a language, I will give you the grammar
- I *won't* give you compiler passes, evaluators, etc.
- Should take only 30-40 minutes
- If you successfully completed the homework assignments, the questions should be easy
- Liberal partial credit applied (especially when you're asked to write code)

# Sample Questions


## Heap allocation

Consider the following program:

    (let ([x 5])
      (let ([y 6])
        (let ([v1 (vector x y)])
          (let ([v2 (vector v1 x v1)])
            (vector v1 v2)))))

1. Assuming registers are *not* used, which variables will be placed on the stack, and which variables will be placed on the root stack?

2. Draw the tags for the vectors `v1` and `v2`.

3. Draw the root stack and heap after this program runs, assuming the initial heap size is large enough that no garbage collection is needed.

Consider the following heap state (root stack and from-space):

4. Complete the diagram by filling the to-space with the new state of the heap *after* garbage collection. Assume Cheney's algorithm for copying collection.

## Functions

5. Circle the *tail calls* in the following program.

```
    (define (fact [x : Integer]) : Integer
      (if (eq? x 0)
          1
          (* x (fact (+ x -1)))))
    
    (define (* [x : Integer] [y : Integer]) : Integer
      (if (eq? x 0)
          1
          (+ y (* (+ x -1) y))))
    
    (fact 5)
```

Consider the following program in R4:

```
    (define (fn [a : Integer]
                [b : Integer]
                [c : Integer]
                [d : Integer]
                [e : Integer]
                [f : Integer]
                [g : Integer]
                [h : Integer]) : Integer
      (+ a (+ b (+ c (+ d (+ e (+ f (+ g h))))))))

    (fn 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)
```

6. Write the output of the `limit-functions` pass on this program (you may omit `has-type` forms).

Consider the following x86 program.

```
    add1start:
      movq %rcx, %rax
      addq $1, %rax
      jmp add1conclusion
    add1:
      pushq %rbp
      movq %rsp, rbp
      jmp add1start
    add1conclusion:
      popq %rbp
      retq
    
    mainstart:
      leaq add1(%rip), %rdx
      movq $5, %rcx
      movq %rdx, %rax
      popq %rbp
      jmp *%rax
    
    .globl main
    main:
      pushq %rbp
      movq %rsp, %rbp
      jmp mainstart
    mainconclusion:
      popq %rbp
      retq
```

7. Write the original R4 program for which this x86 program is (roughly) the output of our compiler.


## Anonymous functions (lambda)

8. What are the free variables of the lambda expression `(lambda (x) (+ x y))`?

Consider the following program:

```
    (let ([y 10])
      (let ([f (lambda (x) y)])
        (let ([y 20])
          (f 5))))
```

9. What is the value of this program under *dynamic scope*?

10. What is the value of this program under *lexical scope*?

11. Perform closure conversion to transform this program into an R4 program (you may omit type annotations). Your transformed code should implement lexical scope.

## Dynamic typing

Consider the following program:

```
    (if #t
        (+ 1 2)
        (+ #f 3))
```

12. Does this program have a *static* type, according to our R4 typechecker?

13. Does running this program result in a *run-time* type error?

14. Convert this program to one which has a static type, according to the R6 typechecker. Use `inject` and `project`.

```
    (if #t
        (+ 1 2)
        (+ #f 3))
```

15. What R6 program corresponds to the following assembly code?

```
    movq $1, %rdx
    saql $3, %rdx
    orq  $4, %rdx
```

16. What R6 program corresponds to the following assembly code? Assume that variable `x` of type `Any` has been placed in `%rcx`.

```
    block1:
      andq $7, %rcx
      cmpq $1, %rcx
      je block2
      movq $-1, %rdi
      callq exit
    block2:
      movq %rcx, %rbx
      sarq $3, %rbx
```

## Objects

Consider the following program in Racket:

    (define rectangle%
      (class object%
             (define width 10)
             (define height 20)
             
             (super-new)
     
             (define/public (area)
               (* width height))))
    
    (define obj (new rectangle%))
    
    (send obj area)

17. Write the method table, represented using a vector, for the `rectangle%` class.

```
    (define rectangle-method-table
      (vector
      
      
      
      
      )
```

18. Compile this program into one which does not use Racket's object system, but instead implements dynamic dispatch via a method table stored in a vector.

## How code gets executed

Consider the following output of `objdump -d adduser.o`:

    adduser.o:    file format Mach-O 64-bit x86-64
    
    Disassembly of section __TEXT,__text:
    _main:
          0:    48 c7 c1 51 00 00 00     movq    $81, %rcx
          7:    48 c7 c2 2d 00 00 00     movq    $45, %rdx
          e:    e8 00 00 00 00     callq    0 <_main+0x13>
         13:    c3     retq

19. What component is responsible for producing the file `adduser.o`?

20. What component is responsible for combining `adduser.o` with another file which contains the definition of the `add` function?
