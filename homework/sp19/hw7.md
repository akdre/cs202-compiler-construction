# Assignment 7

**Solve the exercises in a single Racket source file named
  `compiler-A7.rkt`, and submit your solution in a ZIP file (as
  specified in the [support code GitHub
  repository](https://github.com/jnear/compiler-construction-assignments))
  on the course Blackboard under "Assignment 7".**

**Due: Monday, Apr 22, 11:59pm**

Complete **Exercise 20** in the textbook, extending your compiler to
compile the R4 language outlined in Chapter 6.

The support code repository includes the typechecker for R4, in the
file `typechecker-A7.rkt`, so you will not need to implement it.

**Challenge exercise**: No challenge exercise for this assignment.
